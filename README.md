# Rafflebay
Our project, Rafflebay, is an online marketplace that uses a traditional raffle-based system to buy and sell goods. Our iOS application will consist of a searchable marketplace, where sellers are able to post goods they wish to sell and virtually distribute tickets to potential buyers. Buyers on the platform are able to purchase associated tickets with the item they wish to buy. Once all the tickets for a potential item have been sold, a winner is chosen at random who will receive the good. The seller of the item (e.g. headphones) chooses a selling price (e.g. $100) and a number of tickets to distribute (e.g. 10). The price of each ticket will be the selling price / number-of-tickets (e.g. $10 a ticket) such that the total amount the seller will receive by selling tickets will be equal to the amount he is looking for. This model will allow one ticket purchaser to win the item for an extremely large discount (e.g. 90%) whereas the rest receive nothing. 

The novelty of this project is the ability for users to buy a valued product at an extremely discounted price, with the seller still getting a full price for his product. Additionally, this is a pro-seller market, catered towards boosting seller confidence. With the 2019 Supreme Court ruling which legalized sports betting at a federal level, more states have been proactive in changing state laws regarding online gambling, meaning that lottery-based apps like our own are essentially non-existent, following the trend of many foreign countries. For non-profit organizations, online raffles are already legal, however, no organization has an app-based online raffle service. Further, other raffle companies like rallyup and chance2win require the seller to fully set up the raffle system and handle marketing for purely fundraising, not a seller marketplace. 

This gamification of a traditional marketplace business-model aims to encourage higher spending of consumers and an overall higher transaction rate of purchases. Additional engineering challenges that motivate our project are how to accurately choose winners in a manner that cannot be corrupted (i.e. gathering entropy from all users to minimize pseudo-randomness in the selection), how to limit transactional volume through payment processors through deposits and withdrawals, and how to identify critical function requirements for each user.
